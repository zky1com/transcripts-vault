I've been a huge fan of Codex for a lot of last year. Really dramatically changed how I work, how I build software, and the app has been another step change, and it's made my job even more fun. I trust that it's going to make a lot more progress in one go without, you know, babysitting or handholding. And especially its improved ability to validate the work that it's done to write the code and then, like, automatically run tests or even launch the app and do checks like that. It means that when I get back to that session and it says that it's done, a lot more of a time, you know, it's not just, hey, I wrote a bunch of code and now, you know, you have to build compiler errors or whatever it is. But actually, you know, this code works and, you know, might need some refactoring or polishing, but, you know, I can immediately start testing this thing that I asked to build. And that's been just transformative for all sorts of work. So this is a task where I've been doing a little refactoring related to logging. And this is one of those tasks where Codex can really excel because there is, it's not a complicated task, but it does, it did require modifying a lot of files. And there was also a bit of risk where you're modifying, you know, sort of a crucial component of the app where our regression in this case would have meant our logs stop working and, you know, our observability pipeline breaks, right? So our ability to see the logs in the beta version of the app so we can diagnose back reports would break. So then the way that I would have done this before Codex is, you know, I've made a change. I'm going to compile the app and run it and look if the logs are there, right? So in this case, I just told the model and we can give that a try. I can see it using our logs tool and it's querying some logs. It ran the app and then it tried to find the session ID by writing some Python code. It found right here. Nice. And then now it's using the old logs MCP to go and query that. Yeah, so I just came back to our conversation and the model's telling me that it ran the command that I told it, it found the session ID and then it ran this and it found some logs statement. So I can tell that after our refactor, you know, logs are still being piked. So awesome. That's a piece of work that it just takes to me. That's very cool. Like 10 minutes on this task.
