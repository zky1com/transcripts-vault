## Summary

The discussion centers on cursor, it's, want. Yeah, I want to show some practical tipsÂ about how I use Cursor, how the Cursor team builds Cursor with Cursor, and hopefully things. What's the craziest thing you've seen built with Cursor?Â in terms of software, you know, I've seen some tweets, people being , oh, people. This whole era ofÂ people being able to just build things that they want, I've seen so many people build amazingÂ things in this.

## Key Insights


- and you know back in the day in the Embarcadero there was the over before I think it was the earthquake or something there used to be a above ground train I think or and that was all along the Embarcadero so you would see that and then you would see it go away and the models are going to know about that that would be that would be really cool the other thing to think about is you know a lot of people talk about personal software for these utilities but I actually think personal software as distribution software is something that not a lot of people have talked about.

- But this idea this is cool because this is about a lot of people are vibe coding A lot of people are prototyping but prototypes are cool But we want to create people listening to this want to create production code And a big part of that is software that scales software that secure being quick on when you do have customers being quick on fixing bugs So I think what's cool about this is it gets us closer to there, it gets us there.

- in terms of software, you know, I've seen some tweets, people being , oh, people using Cursor, you know, platforms Cursor, they can only build, you know, little software apps.

- Well, I also think that, you know, if I'm, you know, if I'm a customer and I'm on a I'm on Linear's website and I see that, you know, Linear has a zero bug policy and I'm, you know, comparing JIRA to Linear and I see zero bug policy.

- Yeah, I want to show some practical tips about how I use Cursor, how the Cursor team builds Cursor with Cursor, and hopefully things you can take back and apply to building your next app.

- Yeah, this is a good time I can show you a couple other things, which is one of these kind of code review bots, we used it so much internally, just Cursor building Cursor, for almost a year that we decided to actually turn it into a product.

There's a way to use Cursor where you have AIÂ 
agents working for you. AI agents that do your security. AI agents that do your bugs. If you'reÂ 
anything me, you've tried Cursor, you've used Cursor, but you're not really getting the most outÂ 
of it. So I brought on Lee, who's from the Cursor team, to give us an in-depth tutorial with how toÂ 
squeeze the most out of Cursor. This is for anyone who wants to use Cursor, get the most out of it,Â 
have those AI agents working for you. Enjoy the episode. All right, we got Lee on the pod from theÂ 
Cursor team. And Lee, what are we going to learn today? Yeah, I want to show some practical tipsÂ 
about how I use Cursor, how the Cursor team builds Cursor with Cursor, and hopefully things you canÂ 
take back and apply to building your next app. And so if someone sticks to the end of this episode,Â 
What are they going to take away? My hope is I've been coding for 15 years, and hopefully you canÂ 
steal some of my tips for how I structure my apps, some of the rules and cursor configuration that IÂ 
use to help you get more out of AI agents. Okay, great, because I think a lot of the peopleÂ 
listening, we've tried cursor. It's probably part of our workflow now, but we want to get theÂ 
most out of it. We want to squeeze that juice. And so my hope today is that you're going to help us,Â 
you know, teach us the tips from the inside of how to squeeze the most amount of juice out of cursor,Â 
specifically with these agents. And and just, you know, help us avoid some pitfalls. Absolutely.Â 
Let's do it. All right. Let's rock. Sweet. OK, let me share my screen. All right. So the firstÂ 
thing I want to show is using agents. Now, the view I'm showing right now is something we'reÂ 
kind of cooking up and will be released soon. But it's basically exactly the same as pulling up theÂ 
agent sidebar on the right. The reason I wanted to show this is because it's easy to see all ofÂ 
the different agents that I ran. So yesterday, I'm building a real app, working on a new courseÂ 
platform and documentation site for Cursor. And if you look on the left, I fired off about 20Â 
different agents, 20 different conversations over the day. Actually, I was coding at midnight lastÂ 
night. So there's a few up here at the top that leaked into today. And I want to just talk throughÂ 
some of the common patterns I used here to get the most out of agents in this code base. So let meÂ 
just maybe I'll pick on a few of these and we'll see. There's one that's interesting. Maybe thisÂ 
event tracking one. So I asked it to add event tracking when the add to cursor button for an MCPÂ 
was clicked. And you're going to notice that it goes through. It thinks a little bit. And thenÂ 
it finds that there's no linter errors. So I've taken some measures ahead of time to make sureÂ 
that the agent can basically fix its own outputs. Inside of this code base, which I can show in aÂ 
second, I'm using TypeScript. I have a linter set up. I have formatting set up. I have tests. AndÂ 
all of those things, the agent can read its own outputs and then just self-correct and fix itselfÂ 
without me having to do anything. So I just say, go do this task. Notice it's not really thatÂ 
complex of a prompt. I just said very directly, here's what you need to do. And then we canÂ 
look and, yeah, it did a pretty decent job of what I wanted it to do. Now, you notice I gotÂ 
20 different conversations. Most of these are, what, 30 line changes, 75 line changes, 45 lineÂ 
changes. It's important that you're making new chats or new conversations for each kind ofÂ 
discrete task because every single time you're giving context to the model, you can see here,Â 
it was about 17% of the context window. It's kind of the maximum working memory that the AI agentÂ 
can keep in its brain. So you don't want to clog that up. If you talk to me for 30 minutes, you'reÂ 
probably going to forget something that I said at the beginning of the 30-minute conversation. SoÂ 
for each new task, you get the best quality out of working with the model. You can just startÂ 
new chats for each thing that you want to do. So when you look through here, it's not that I'mÂ 
doing super complex, detailed prompts. I'm kind of just asking, , hey, it looks there was some layoutÂ 
shift on this video. Let's fix this script that I have. You know, let's replace this. Prompts here,Â 
we want to just remove this custom component, remove this file. We got this error in the editor,Â 
and we said, could not find the file declaration for this module, and I needed to resolve how thatÂ 
worked. And it went and said, okay, you need to add this type in your file. So really the promptsÂ 
are not too detailed, but what you'll notice that I do is that I explicitly tag in files. when IÂ 
want to pull them into the context. I want to stuff them in the agent's brain. So when I said,Â 
when you go to a new item in our kind of left sidebar that has all the different links in ourÂ 
course, our documentation site, it should reset the filter input and reset the sidebar outlineÂ 
to the starting state. And so I'm just very directly telling it what it should be doing. AndÂ 
it goes through, it thinks, it reads the files, it makes some changes, and then again, it reads theÂ 
linter outputs and it says, okay, the changes that the agent made are correct. We've got the rightÂ 
code. We know that it's past all the checks and balances. If you, if you've, and this is actuallyÂ 
a broader question, if you've never, if you're not a developer, should you even use this? ShouldÂ 
you even use Cursor or Linters or? Both. Yeah, if you're not a developer, there's kind of aÂ 
spectrum of I don't want to look at the code, right? Or I'm interested in just kind of buildingÂ 
an app, and I do want to take over the code and actually start to learn what it means to buildÂ 
products, build software. There's a growing number of tools, I think, that are making it easier forÂ 
people who never really want to look at the code to build software. And I think that that willÂ 
exist and grow, and people will do that. But from what I've seen, you kind of reach a point whereÂ 
eventually you kind of have to look at the code. and it's going to make your life a lot easierÂ 
as you start to figure out how the code works. You don't need to be an expert, but you can startÂ 
to kind of tune those skills and it gives you a superpower that previously was just a little bitÂ 
harder to do. It's you peel back the layers of the abstraction to the code. The code is the source ofÂ 
truth. And now you can just do whatever you want. Yeah, it's kind of looking under the hood of theÂ 
car. 100%. That's how it works, right? The analogy I to give is in the future, there will always beÂ 
people who love their cars. You know, they go buy different parts and they pull up the engine andÂ 
they tweak all of the different, you know, they buy parts online and they change everything aboutÂ 
their engine setup or the exhaust or whatever. And then there's the millions and millions ofÂ 
people who just drive cars. And, , both are legit and valid and fine. There's going to be a ton ofÂ 
people who build software and can build products. And then there's also going to be people who, youÂ 
know, artisanally write code by hand every day and don't use AI. And that's the thing that they love.Â 
And that's also valid. I think both will coexist. Real quick, I need to tell you about somethingÂ 
that's helping me sleep better at night as an entrepreneur. I was running multiple companiesÂ 
with money scattered everywhere zero spending visibility and making growth decisions prettyÂ 
blind I knew there had to be a better way and my friend told me about Brax So I switched and nowÂ 
I have mission control for every dollar. Spend management and visibility, virtual cards for myÂ 
team and earning cash from the same day treasury product. I was leaving so much money on the table,Â 
but not any more. I have a financial operating system for our businesses to make decisions so IÂ 
can spend smarter and move faster. And it's been a total game changer. I'm loving Brex so much. IÂ 
reached out to them and asked them to sponsor the pod. Start sleeping better. Your financialÂ 
OS is waning. Brex is giving SIP listeners $7,500 in perks at brex.com slash SIP. Cool. Okay,Â 
I took some notes on this. What else do we need to learn? Yeah, I want to show a different screen.Â 
So going back to the normal kind of cursor window that most of you are familiar with, I have a fewÂ 
rules and commands set up that are helpful in my project. So this one, I'm writing a lot of contentÂ 
here, docs and educational material. And I've kind of built this mega prompt of everything that IÂ 
about writing. And there's some things on voice and tone. There's some things on being specific.Â 
But then I also just built this list of banned words. And I'm sure I've cribbed some of theseÂ 
from different places online or books that I've read. But I've just tried to delete the marketingÂ 
speak out of people's brains. So mission critical, performant, seamless, some of these things areÂ 
fine and all rules can be broken. Right. But this is just a helpful list of me trying to deleteÂ 
some of these overused words or overused phrases. And my most recent addition here is also trying toÂ 
catalog some of the LLM patterns, the junk that it spits out. this is the most recent one I've seenÂ 
people talking about. it's not just X, it's Y. And , once you see it, you can't unsee it or theÂ 
LLMs all generate the same style of writing. So this has been helpful for me as kind of just aÂ 
quick pass when I'm writing something. It's , hey, am I making sure that I'm not doing anything, youÂ 
know, completely robot sounding? Yeah, this is really smart. I should do this because I do a lotÂ 
of writing. And I do this manually right now. So the fact that this can just be, you know, somewhatÂ 
automated is really big. , beyond writing, what are other, you know, common use cases thatÂ 
you can, you know, use rules for? Yeah. Yeah, I'm happy to send you this prompt, by the way.Â 
Another one is custom commands. So this is a little bit more of a detailed command for thingsÂ 
that I to do when I'm reviewing code. So if you're newer to coding, some of these things might seem aÂ 
little overwhelming, but you can kind of dial this up or dial this down. The idea holds true, though,Â 
which is that you have the agents. And inside of here now I can run slash code review. So I've gotÂ 
this slash command and that slash command is just driven by this file, this markdown file. We canÂ 
make whatever we want. We can do code review, security review, vibe check. we could we couldÂ 
do whatever we want here. And inside of my code review custom slash command here. It's justÂ 
little gotchas that have kind of bit me in the past. , hey, did you think about what wouldÂ 
happen when there's no Internet? Did you think about what would happen when the application isÂ 
loading information? Did you handle that with a nice loading spinner? Did you did you write goodÂ 
tests? Did you write smaller number of tests that are really good versus just spamming a bunch ofÂ 
garbage? Did you change the authentication? If you did, you might want to run and do a securityÂ 
review. Did you have, you know, places where we might want to speed things up with caching, someÂ 
of these more advanced software engineering terms and concepts and just building these own kindÂ 
of customized commands and customized prompts for your use case has been very helpful for meÂ 
as well. Yeah, and I'd imagine in the future, you don't have to quote me on this, in the futureÂ 
you would think that a lot of these agents, so to speak, would come stock with Cursor. Yes.Â 
Because so many projects require this. Yeah, this is a good time I can show you a couple otherÂ 
things, which is one of these kind of code review bots, we used it so much internally, just CursorÂ 
building Cursor, for almost a year that we decided to actually turn it into a product. And it'sÂ 
called BugBot, and it allows you to do essentially what we just talked about. The code review promptÂ 
that I had was more of kind of my own preference, not just kind of finding bugs. But we have anotherÂ 
one called BugBot, which just to give the context of this repo, I've got a docs repo for cursor.Â 
I wanted to add some docs about extensions. So I actually kicked this off with an agent. And ifÂ 
I want to make any follow-up changes, I can just tag at cursor on GitHub, and it will just go makeÂ 
the changes for me. But then I got this comment from BugBot. And BugBot from cursor was , hey,Â 
by the way, I think you missed some of the other languages. So we have our docs internationalizedÂ 
to a bunch of different languages. And I was , you missed a few, bro. So I need to go throughÂ 
and pick some of those things. So this is the built-in code review bot, basically, which youÂ 
can make some that are custom. So with our CLI, which I can show in a second, you can run the CLIÂ 
in your GitHub Actions or whatever your deployment platform of choice, your CI platform of choiceÂ 
is. So this one, for example, you could audit your repository for security vulnerabilities. AndÂ 
you just dump the CLI into this CI script and you can run the cursor agent. So the agent that I justÂ 
showed that was in the cursor editor, the GUI, you can run it headlessly. You can run it justÂ 
behind the scenes through the CLI. It's the same logic, the same idea, the same power. But now I'mÂ 
giving this prompt and I'm running it basically in automation. And I can just automate away and doÂ 
whatever I want. So you could automatically update your docs every time somebody on the team mergesÂ 
a PR. You could automatically fix things and push commits back to your branch if the CI fails. SoÂ 
if your test failed or something else fails. And this is just a few of the ideas. There's so manyÂ 
different things you can do with this where you can have complete control and automation overÂ 
what you're doing. And another thing I wanted to show is here was another example of where IÂ 
used an agent to kick off a PR. And I actually went ahead and included the screenshot down below.Â 
I got a report on X that this button didn't work. So I'm in Slack. And I just kind of pasted in whatÂ 
they said. And I said, at cursor, here's the repo. Investigate this bug and fix it. And then it comesÂ 
back and it says, okay, here's the fix. I go out to the PR. I look at the code. I go test it. I'mÂ 
, yeah, seems good. And it just saved me so much time. I didn't have to go open up the editor.Â 
I just kicked it off from Slack on my phone. It was amazing. Yeah, , first of all, I actually hadÂ 
no idea this existed. I don't know if this is new or not. But this idea this is cool because thisÂ 
is about a lot of people are vibe coding A lot of people are prototyping but prototypes are coolÂ 
But we want to create people listening to this want to create production code And a big part ofÂ 
that is software that scales software that secure being quick on when you do have customers beingÂ 
quick on fixing bugs So I think what's cool about this is it gets us closer to there, it gets usÂ 
there. Yeah, and the idea is basically that same cursor agent you can use in the editor. You canÂ 
use it from Slack. You can use it from the web. So if you go to cursor.com slash agents, sameÂ 
idea. I can just go here and kick off prompts, and they can run in the cloud. So they run in thisÂ 
secure virtual sandbox. In the same way, I can do it in the editor when I have local files on myÂ 
machine. So I'm on the go. I'm, , in the car, and I can just go to cursor.com slash agents andÂ 
kick things off, similar to other of the, , vibe coding prototyping tools. Similar idea hereÂ 
where I can integrate with all of our kind of production repos and just fix little things this,Â 
typo changes, docs issues, the padding's wrong, I want to change the color, little things that.Â 
To your point, really helps with having great customer service and being able to turn aroundÂ 
bug fixes super, super fast. I can try to find and pull up the tweet from Linear, but LinearÂ 
has this amazing policy where â€“ oh, here it is. they have this amazing policy where they have aÂ 
zero bug policy and they use cursor. If you look, this is inside of linear. Let's see if I canÂ 
make this a little bigger. Maybe not. Well, a PM reports a bug. The AI categorizes it. TheÂ 
engineer who's triaging just tells cursor, Hey, investigate this and fix it. It opens up the PR.Â 
They fix it and they accept the change. And they just turn this around just incredibly fast forÂ 
basically any issue that gets reported. And I think a lot of teams are going to start operatingÂ 
in this way. This isn't going to solve , it's not going to say just build me a billion dollar SaaS,Â 
make no mistakes. But this is bugs, small things, you know, little things, the drudge work ofÂ 
building software. Well, I also think that, you know, if I'm, you know, if I'm a customer andÂ 
I'm on a I'm on Linear's website and I see that, you know, Linear has a zero bug policy and I'm,Â 
you know, comparing JIRA to Linear and I see zero bug policy. I might be more likely to buyÂ 
the software that says that. 100%. So there's real value, right? there's real positioning andÂ 
marketing value when you actually say something that, which is huge alpha. A million percent.Â 
And the last thing I'll just show quickly is, I mentioned, we have the headless way you can useÂ 
Cursor Agent. You can also use this in the CLI. If you're the type of person who prefers Vim orÂ 
you prefer JetBrains or you prefer other editors, or maybe you just really the terminal, I thinkÂ 
more advanced engineers love this stuff. So I could say in here, , let's add end-to-end testsÂ 
with whatever tool you want. I could just say Playwright, or you could just not even say whatÂ 
tool, for testing, submitting prompts in the chat. Sure. And it's the same idea, right? It looksÂ 
similar. It feels similar. It has the ability to work with basically any AI model, call differentÂ 
tools, which are essentially skills. So you give the model skills to go read files, write files,Â 
search your code base, look up things on the web. It's you're training it with all these skills. AndÂ 
then it can go and make changes. You give it this kind of ambiguous or maybe not ambiguous, but thisÂ 
broad task. just go add tests. Make it good. Make it great. And it can go and kind of figure outÂ 
what you want to do. It can run terminal commands. It says, hey, what do you want to do? Do you wantÂ 
to allow kind of installing things? I'm just going to put it on YOLO mode. Auto run all commands.Â 
Great. Just do whatever you want. That's fine. This is full vibe. And it can manage the to-dos.Â 
It's going to go install the dependencies, set up the configuration file. So very similar thingÂ 
here with what I was showing kind of in the visual editor. This is cool. This is very cool. I mean, IÂ 
personally, I'm not super advanced. So personally, this is a bit, a little bit, it's cool to see,Â 
but a little bit daunting to me personally. Yeah, I feel that. But , I know that there's, youÂ 
know, I'll call them real developers, seeing, you know, who do feel more comfortable inÂ 
an environment that. Yeah, I personally do not daily code with a CLI. I being ableÂ 
to stop and review the code in the editor, kind of click through the files. That's just theÂ 
way I've built software forever, and it still clicks with my brain. But some people definitelyÂ 
enjoy that way, for sure. Before we head out, is there anything we're missing around if someoneÂ 
is going to use cursor today, how can they get the most out of it? I think that for a lot of people,Â 
they have this tendency to make their conversation this append-only, they just continue in oneÂ 
chat forever. and I don't think they realized, I noticed this with a lot of people gettingÂ 
started, people are just kind of graduating from vibe coding into building a real productionÂ 
app and they're , it was great at first, but then it got bad and they're trying to figure out , whyÂ 
did it get bad? Did it get bad because there's just a lot more code now? Did they secretly makeÂ 
the models worse? Is there some conspiracy? And almost always when I work with people and tryÂ 
to debug what went wrong, they're just trying to give the model way too much stuff So I mentionedÂ 
with that context window, if it gets up to 100%, Cursor can automatically summarize and keepÂ 
going. But you don't really actually want to do that because if you get to 80% or 90%, it's justÂ 
very likely that there's so much junk in there, so much context, that the model can get confused.Â 
And there's actually been some early research that has shown in long context tasks, especially withÂ 
models that can have a million tokens of context, so just a ton of stuff. You don't really wantÂ 
to be kind of running that as your daily way of coding where it's , , just give it 500,000 tokensÂ 
of context. It just gets really confused, and they have measured this kind of quality drop-off as youÂ 
get further and further up that chain. So I would just be very mindful about how much context you'reÂ 
providing. And for new tasks, for new features, start a new chat, you know, start a new window,Â 
and kind of start from scratch again. What's the craziest thing you've seen built with Cursor?Â 
in terms of software, you know, I've seen some tweets, people being , oh, people using Cursor,Â 
you know, platforms Cursor, they can only build, you know, little software apps. Is that true? OrÂ 
can you build, you know, some serious software apps? Yeah, I think a few that have been fun forÂ 
me. One is seeing the new generation of people who can just build software now that previouslyÂ 
wouldn't have been able to do that and see what they come up with. that is just completely, it'sÂ 
not what I would ever have imagined. So we did a meetup a couple days ago, and a few people broughtÂ 
their parents, their parents brought their kids to the meetups. And there was a six-year-old kidÂ 
coding with cursor, which is mind-blowing to me. I was stacking Legos and, , sucking on my thumb orÂ 
something when I was six years old. I don't know. And, , six-year-old, , building with AI is justÂ 
amazing. So that's one thing. And the other thing that I've seen that's amazing, when the marginalÂ 
cost of writing software is zero when coding is easy when coding you can just generate a bunchÂ 
of code there are certain types of things you can build that previously you would just never do thatÂ 
A great example is very very detailed and thorough debugging tools So you run into a problem in yourÂ 
app. And sure, you can add some logging. You can try to step through all of the editor things.Â 
Or you can ask the AI to write a complete visual interface for you to debug and figure out what theÂ 
heck is going wrong. Now, this doesn't make sense for every single issue that you run into, but I'veÂ 
now seen a couple instances where people built these, , custom heads-up displays where they couldÂ 
step through what was going on in the application. Or they built this, , side-by-side A-B test thingÂ 
where they were migrating from app A to app B, and they could, , review each change along theÂ 
way. You would never build custom software for that in the past. , it's throwaway. You would useÂ 
it once and then be done with it. But when writing code isn't the hard part, it's , well, heck, yeah,Â 
I want a visual GUI to watch this migration. That sounds awesome. Totally. And I also think, I mean,Â 
this whole era of they call it personal software, right? Yeah. So, you know, this idea that,Â 
yeah, you might just want to create this disposable piece of software for this one useÂ 
case. And it makes your life easier. So you're doing it. there's also this idea that there'sÂ 
probably a really big business to be created in creating personal software for companies too,Â 
right? a lot of people listen to this show, Startup Ideas Podcast. So a lot of people hereÂ 
have ideas. And I think that if you're trying to, one of the simplest businesses to start is go andÂ 
just use Cursor and build personal software for some vertical. Is it healthcare companies? IsÂ 
it fintech companies? Is it boring businesses? I think there's a huge opportunity there. QuickÂ 
plug, I actually wrote a blog post about personal software, lerob.com slash personal softwareÂ 
that talks a little bit about this. It's super inspiring and exciting for me. This whole era ofÂ 
people being able to just build things that they want, I've seen so many people build amazingÂ 
things in this way. And you mentioned that you were talking with Logan about Nana Banana fromÂ 
Google. And I've seen people talking on X recently about the capabilities of that model are so good.Â 
You can just go into Cursor and build a vertical of some AI generation, image generation app thatÂ 
is going to be 10 times better than anything else that exists. So removing backgrounds or trying onÂ 
clothes or architecture before and after photos, things that people who haven't caught up toÂ 
the speed of technology, they haven't seen, the latest versions of the models are , wow,Â 
how the heck did they build this? This must have taken so much work. And in reality, it's ,Â 
it's just a model call now. And you're making it accessible to hundreds of millions more people,Â 
basically. Have you seen Peter Level's tweets over the last 24 hours? Banana, banana. He'sÂ 
, yeah, his mind is blown of how good it is, right? So and he's, you know, can you actuallyÂ 
pull up his ex account. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I saw what you're talking about. He was droppingÂ 
some amazing knowledge for people. The thing I love that he does is I think he inspires a lot ofÂ 
people to just think bigger and really try to say, you could also be an entrepreneur. You could alsoÂ 
just build these amazing things. Yeah, I think he just saw what, obviously he's been in the spaceÂ 
for a while because he's been building photo AI. So he's been playing with the models. And IÂ 
think he said it's the internet. Oh my God. Show us inside area 51. That's another use case. No,Â 
it's true. Yeah. He had one about, , Oh, this is a good one. If you're not building a mini startupÂ 
with nano banana today and launching it tomorrow, you're missing the opportunity of a lifetime. ThisÂ 
image model just made hundreds of new startups and apps possible. Your only limit is creativityÂ 
and how fast you can ship. So true. that's banger advice. Right. So I think your point is withÂ 
cursor, you just call the model. go in, I mean, you have to come up with a good idea, right?Â 
Yeah. And you have to have some distribution or understand how to get distribution. But there'sÂ 
this window right now to create software with this model. Yeah. imagine this in an app form. It's youÂ 
can drag the map around on the web and then you can turn it into exactly this fancy image thatÂ 
you want to see. And then maybe on this image, there's different button filters. You canÂ 
apply different styles maybe there's a slider that slides it throughout history. So you do theÂ 
arrow pointing at San Francisco, downtown on the Embarcadero. And then you can slide it from 1930Â 
all the way to 2020. and you know back in the day in the Embarcadero there was the over before IÂ 
think it was the earthquake or something there used to be a above ground train I think or andÂ 
that was all along the Embarcadero so you would see that and then you would see it go away and theÂ 
models are going to know about that that would be that would be really cool the other thing toÂ 
think about is you know a lot of people talk about personal software for these utilities but IÂ 
actually think personal software as distribution software is something that not a lot of peopleÂ 
have talked about. So how do you create a piece of software that, you know, goes viral on X or,Â 
or gets a lot of traction that, , builds you the distribution that you can basically use it almostÂ 
as a lead magnet to get and then sell your actual piece of software. Yeah, I actually, I'll, , I'llÂ 
show you something that I don't know exactly how to put it into a blog post yet, but what you'veÂ 
described, I've been sitting on for a while and I've been thinking about, and I've been calling itÂ 
a distribution engineer. I just keep Apple notes because, you know, why not? And indie hackersÂ 
know this, right? They build in public. It's not necessarily about getting followers. It's aboutÂ 
getting distribution. And it's the same when you look at basically any other part of buildingÂ 
software. If you build docs, well, you want people to read them, right? So they need to beÂ 
distributed. If you're building a community, you want to be more than one person. So you have toÂ 
figure out distribution. Distribution is all you need. It's not really about necessarily just theÂ 
product, but you want the product to actually get used. And there's something here because in theÂ 
past I've talked about how front end and back end went to more product engineers. You were caring aÂ 
lot more about the product. And now that product is becoming easier and easier to build, there isÂ 
something here to this distribution angle where, okay, I've got a product and I'm an entrepreneur.Â 
I'm trying to get it out into the world. Figuring out distribution is huge. It's huge. Lee, alwaysÂ 
a pleasure having you on. You're the GOAT, man. I'm excited that you're now at Cursor. I'mÂ 
not affiliated with Cursor at all. I just think it's a cool product. Yeah, man. Let's get theÂ 
comment section going for Lee. I'd love you to come back on. Do , you know, people listening doÂ 
this video if you want more of this in your feed. And I'll include links to follow Lee on all socialÂ 
platforms. So go ahead and follow him there. Lee, anything you want to leave us with? Man, thanksÂ 
so much. It's been a blast chatting and all your recent guests have been fired. So keep up the goodÂ 
work. I appreciate it. Take care, my man. See ya.
